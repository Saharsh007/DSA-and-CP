why it's so important : 
Linked lists? Print a linked list in reverse order.
Strings? Determine if a string is a palindrome.
Trees and graphs? Have fun doing an iterative DFS.
Dynamic programming? Okay do you get my point? This is all recursive.

can't do these without recursion..

to understand recursion 
1. Draw recursion Tree
2. don't lose track of your variables
3. practice.

Where to use recursion?
1. Hierarchies, Networks, or Graphs
2. Multiple Related Decisions
3.Explicit Recursive Relationships

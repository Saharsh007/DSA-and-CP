overlapping subprolem:

1. Does the problem involve maximization, minimization, optimization or counting?
ex shortest path through the maze : MINIMIZATION PROBLEM
    longest path through the maze : maximization problem

2. The problem requires to go through all the solutions to find the best one. This is also DP.

3. Try the FIRST method.
Find the first solution, Analyze the solution, identify the Subproblems, and Turn around the solution

    a. FIND BRUTE FORCE APPROACH.
        HOW?
        each recursive call must be self contained, that is no global variable updation.
        few arguments to pass to the function as possible.
    b. ANALYZE THE FIRST SOLUTION
        draw the tree to know the complexity and identify if it has overlapping and optimal substructure problem.
    c. IDNETIFY THE SUBPROBLEMS .
    d. TRUN AROUND THE SOULTION
        convert top-down approach to bottom-up approach as it's faster.
        bottom-up approach is iterative.
